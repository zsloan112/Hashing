Implementing a Hash Table with Chaining:
----------------------------------------

1.  Create a hash table with 20 slots.
	- Array pointer to a node with an integer value
	- Each slot is a sorted singly linked list
2. Hash Function:
	- h(k) = k mod 20

3. The program has the following menu options
	1. Insert - Create a new node with value and insert to right slot in right location 			in the list. Does not allow an insert of a value that is already in the 			map
	2. Delete - Search for a key value and delete from a list in a slot. If there is no 			such node, display and error message 
	3. Search - Search for a key value and display key value with slot number
	4. Print elements in each slot - Print all values in each slot
	5. Quit Program
